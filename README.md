# Processing Task 5 - Loopy Lab

## Learning Objectives
In this task, you will apply your understanding of for loops, if statements and nested loops to form interesting patterns.



## Step 1 - Lesson
Start by reviewing [the examples in 2.8 Nested Loops](https://replit.com/@EricFabroa/28-Nested-Loops#Main.java) and [For Loops from HappingCoding.io](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/for-loops).


## Step 2 - Task
The goal of this lab is to practice using nested ``for`` loops. We will create
a program that makes the following image:

For sanity's sake, let's give a number to each section.
Then when we ask questions we can say which section we are talking about.
Do **not** put the numbers in the final program. Here are the section numbers:

Great! All these items can be created using nested ``for`` loops.

The code to get started is in the Sketch.java file.  Your job is to complete the code in each section (i.e `draw_section1()`, `draw_section2()`, etc).  

## Evaluation
* Level 2 - 4 sections
* Level 3 - 6 sections
* Level 4 - 8 sections

## Submission
1. Commit and push your code to this repository
2. Take a screenshot of your work and upload it to the Google Classroom assignment post
